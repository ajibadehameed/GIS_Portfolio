# GIS_Portfolio
## Welcome to my GIS and Spatial Data Science Portfolio.
Welcome to my GIS and spatial data science portfolio. This repository showcases selected projects that combine geospatial analysis, environmental data, and visual storytelling to solve real-world problems.

Each project highlights my skills in GIS software (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS), spatial statistics, remote sensing, and environmental data visualization using Python, R, and MATLAB.

##  Featured Projects

###  [2015 UK Election](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/UK_Election)
*Tools:* ArcGIS Pro, UK Election Data  
This project visualizes the results of the 2015 United Kingdom General Election using different cartographic approaches to represent political data. The visualizations highlight geographic voting patterns, party dominance across constituencies, and share of votes.

###  [Kenya Drought and Conflict Mapping](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/Kenya_Conflicts)
*Tools:* ArcGIS Pro, Anselin Local Moran‚Äôs I, Precipitation & Conflict Data  
- Performed spatiotemporal analysis of drought conditions and pastoral conflict zones across Kenya.  
- Superimposed conflict data on monthly precipitation maps for 2000, 2008, and 2015.  
- Used local spatial statistics to identify significant hot/cold spots.  
- Created seasonal climate plots (precipitation, temperature) to support findings.

###  [3D- Terrain Map](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/3DTerrainMap)
*Tools:*  ArcGIS Pro, Arc Scene

- Understand elevation surface types: DEM vs DSM
- Author 3D terrain views with pre- and post-event data
- Assign elevation layers to 2D raster content
- Improve visual realism and analytical accuracy in 3D mapping

###  [Land Use & Land Cover Change Analysis](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/landuse-change-kenya)
*Tools:* ArcGIS, Remote Sensing, Conflict Overlay  
- Mapped LULC change across Kenya for 2000, 2008, and 2015.  
- Superimposed spatial conflict data on LULC maps to reveal socio-ecological patterns.  
- Interpreted results for policy and peacebuilding implications.
