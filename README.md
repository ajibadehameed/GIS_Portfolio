# GIS_Portfolio
## Welcome to my GIS and Spatial Data Science Portfolio.
Welcome to my GIS and spatial data science portfolio. This repository showcases selected projects that combine geospatial analysis, environmental data, and visual storytelling to solve real-world problems.

Each project highlights my skills in GIS software (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS), spatial statistics, remote sensing, and environmental data visualization using Python, R, and MATLAB.

## üìå Featured Projects

### üîπ [Kenya Drought and Conflict Mapping](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/kenya-drought-conflict)
*Tools:* ArcGIS Pro, Anselin Local Moran‚Äôs I, Precipitation & Conflict Data  
- Performed spatiotemporal analysis of drought conditions and pastoral conflict zones across Kenya.  
- Superimposed conflict data on monthly precipitation maps for 2000, 2008, and 2015.  
- Used local spatial statistics to identify significant hot/cold spots.  
- Created seasonal climate plots (precipitation, temperature) to support findings.

### üîπ [NDVI & Environmental Monitoring](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/ndvi-timeseries)
*Tools:* MODIS NDVI, Python, ArcGIS Pro  
- Analyzed vegetation trends using NDVI indices over multiple years.  
- Integrated time-series analysis with land cover transitions to identify degradation zones.  
- Visualized change patterns alongside climate data.

### üîπ [Land Use & Land Cover Change Analysis](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/landuse-change-kenya)
*Tools:* ArcGIS, Remote Sensing, Conflict Overlay  
- Mapped LULC change across Kenya for 2000, 2008, and 2015.  
- Superimposed spatial conflict data on LULC maps to reveal socio-ecological patterns.  
- Interpreted results for policy and peacebuilding implications.

### üîπ [Tainted Crop Hotspot Visualization](https://github.com/ajibadehameed/tainted-crops-visualization)
*Tools:* ArcGIS Pro  
- Mapped harvested tainted crop data to visualize potential contamination clusters.  
- Proposed further analysis using proximity to pollution sources and crop types.
